# fastapi_network
Simple social network

In general, everything is simple, so I will omit that you will need to download it, install everything, etc.

I didn't implement the front end because I don't want to, and I didn't have such a goal from the beginning. I tested all the functionality on https://hoppscotch.io. It seemed to me the most convenient tool with a user-friendly interface.
I tested dockerfile and docker-compose with wsl and everything worked.

I also used some more graphical than practical libs like pipenv with its friendlier output.
